SEA8 - Quest: The dates

Challenge: Date formatting

In order to practice creating dates, first of all make a Fork of the following deposit then clone it locally.

Be sure to do a _Fork_ or you won't be able to grow anything !

    1. Once the project is locally recovered, open the fileTestDate.java
    2. You will see that it already contains code to retrieve three data: a day, a month and a year.
    3. Use this data and your knowledge gained in the quest to calculate the following information:

A date formatted as "month-day-year", ex: 04-22-2019 The day of the week corresponding to the date, ex: 2

Concatenates texts _"The date is: "_ and _"The day of week is:"_ in front of the corresponding data, before displaying them in the terminal.

Expected outcome :

    Please fill a day (1-31) :
    22
    Please fill a month (1-12) :
    4
    Please fill a year :
    2019
    The date is : 04-22-2019
    The day of week is : 2
